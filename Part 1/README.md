Use a simple dataset for a first touch with the Regression problem and the training, validation and check the employed neuro-fuzzy models.

# Dataset
The code uses the Cycle Combined Power Plant (CCPP) dataset which consists of 9568 samples and 4 features. It is available in the UCI Repository. 

# Evaluation Metrics 
- RMSE
- NMSE
- NDEI
- R<exp>2</exp>
