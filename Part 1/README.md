# Main Idea
Use a simple dataset for a first touch with the Regression problem and the training, validation and final check of the employed neuro-fuzzy models.

# Dataset
The code uses the Cycle Combined Power Plant (CCPP) dataset which consists of 9568 samples and 4 features. It is available in the UCI Repository. 

# Evaluation Metrics 
- RMSE
- NMSE
- NDEI
- R<sup>2</sup>

These metrics have been implemented in the respetive files found in the main folder and need to be included in the same repository as the `part1` file for it to execute.
